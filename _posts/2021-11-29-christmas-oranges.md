Here is an original craft for friends and family to enjoy. It also makes a very nice 
Christmas present.

First, I used a tool  called a zester. A zester is a tool that allows you to make
different shapes on your orange. Basically, you use the little notch to carve your shape 
into the orange. It then makes it easier to put the cloves in. You don't really need it, 
it only makes it easier to put the cloves in, as I said earlier.

Afterwards, I used a toothpick and made holes in the gauges I had just carved so it would
be easier to put the cloves in.

Then, the orange was ready for the cloves.

There are many variations of this project.
