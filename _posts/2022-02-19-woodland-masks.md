title:  "Woodland Masks!"
---

Lately, I've been looking for things to do. Then I found these woodland masks and I fell 
in LOVE!!!

What you will need for this simple but time-consuming craft:

![You will need...](/assets/IMG_4634.JPG)


-Felt in assorted colours


-Rotary cutter & cutting mat or  sewing scissors & pen


-Embroidery thread


-scissors (to cut the patterns)


-1/4 inch elastics (or any width of elastic you have that isn't too wide)
 
 So first, print the patterns on [here,](https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/typekit/files/bear-all.pdf)
 [here,](https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/typekit/files/fox-all.pdf) and [here.](https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/typekit/files/owl-mask.pdf)
 Then, cut out the elastic at desired length.
 
 Then, cut the pattern(s) out!

 After you've cut out the patterns, they're supposed to look like this:

Then, just lay out the pieces one on top of the other, like so, to see how it looks:

Aren't they cute?

Now, It's time to sew them together! Using a basic running stitch,  sew on their noses,
eyes, cheeks, etc. If you want, you can even stuff some of the noses or cheeks of some of
your animals, like i did.

Then, you can sew the second layer of your mask on! Remember, you have to sew on your 
elastics! So when you get to the place on your mask where you want to put your elastics 
on, sew the 2 plies of felt + the elastic!

And...

You're done! Aren't they pretty?
