I just made my own with the sewing machine I got last year for Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IMG_7617.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Assembling the pattern&quot; /&gt;
The pattern I used was obviously very big, so I had to print the pattern and assemble it
according to the letters written on it. An actual puzzle!
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IMG_7620.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Laying Out the Pattern&quot; /&gt;
This is me with the (finally) cut-out pieces. The material I used for the robe was black 
 cotton and some other red fabric that I don’t remember the name(for the lining).
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IMG_7628.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Only a beginning&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IMG_7627.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Only a beginning v.2&quot; /&gt;
Basically, I sewed the front and back pieces. (I had fun turning myself into a fox to 
hide my face.:) )
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IMG_7702.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;final result&quot; /&gt;
And this was the final result. I used a chopstick as a wand (the wands where as expensive
 as the costumes). Unluckily, it rained that time so we were all sopping wet when we came 
 back from trick-or-treating. :(&lt;/p&gt;
