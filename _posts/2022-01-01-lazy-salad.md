---

This is a ridiculously easy salad for those days where you just feel like sitting around.


Have you ever had one of those days where you just feel like sitting around? Me too. Well,
on those days, you still have to eat, right? I suggest using this recipe. Every Friday, 
we do a lazy supper: Freezer pizza and a salad (I highly suggest this, because it  will 
remove a lot of the week's stress), so yesterday I made this super quick and super easy
Lazy Day Salad!

For this recipe,you will need:

-A tsp. of red wine vinegar 

-A large pinch of salt
