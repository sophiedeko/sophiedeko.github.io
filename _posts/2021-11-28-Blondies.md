Blondies are a succulent dessert that can be made at all times: should it be winter or 
summer.
 

This weekend I made blondies, a kind of cookie bar that looks like this:

Anyways, the recipe was really fun to make and I would like to share the fun of making 
them, so here's the recipe:

- 2 cups packed brown sugar    
- 2/3 cup butter
- 2 eggs
- 2 tsp. vanilla
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1/4 tsp. baking soda
- 1 1/2 cups almonds, pecans, walnuts, peanuts or any other nut you wish to add to the 
mixture.
2. Preheat oven at 350 F. Grease a 13x9x2 inch baking pan; set aside. In a medium 
saucepan, heat and stir The brown sugar and the butter over medium heat until butter melts
and  mixture is smooth. Cool slightly. Stir in eggs, one at a time. Stir in vanilla. Stir 
in flour, baking powder, and baking soda.

3. Spread batter in prepared baking pan. Sprinkle with nuts. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or 
until toothpick comes out clean. Cool slightly and cut into bars  while still warm, but
not too hot or else your Blondies will be ruined.

The final result was fantastic;
