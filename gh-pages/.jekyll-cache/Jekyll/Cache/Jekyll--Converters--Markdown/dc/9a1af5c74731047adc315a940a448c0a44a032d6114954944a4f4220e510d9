I"_<p>For Halloween this year, getting a Hermione costume would’ve been really expensive, so
I just made my own with the sewing machine I got last year for Christmas!</p>

The pattern I used was obviously very big, so I had to print the pattern and assemble it
according to the letters written on it. An actual puzzle!

This is me with the (finally) cut-out pieces. The material I used for the robe was black 
 cotton and some other red fabric that I don’t remember the name(for the lining).

Basically, I sewed the front and back pieces. (I had fun turning myself into a fox to 
hide my face.:) )

And this was the final result. I used a chopstick as a wand (the wands where as expensive
 as the costumes). Unluckily, it rained that time so we were all sopping wet when we came 
 back from trick-or-treating. :(</p>
