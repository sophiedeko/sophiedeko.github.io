I"ë<p>For Halloween this year, getting a Hermione costume wouldâ€™ve been really expensive, so
I just made my own with the sewing machine I got last year for Christmas!</p>

The pattern I used was obviously very big, so I had to print the pattern and assemble it
according to the letters written on it. An actual puzzle!

This is me with the (finally) cut-out pieces. The material I used for the robe was black 
 cotton and some other red fabric that I donâ€™t remember the name(for the lining).
